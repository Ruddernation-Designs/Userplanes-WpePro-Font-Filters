I've added these as I think they could be useful for someone.

To use these you will nee to have the software WPE-Pro (Windows Packet Editor - Professional) be aware that WPE is classed as unsafe software due to the nature of its excistence,
Be careful when trying to obtain a version of this software.

If you would like a version then let me know and I'll upload the one I have somewhere or email to you.
